# Jews of Color: Histories and Futures

## Description
"Jews of Color: Histories and Futures," supported by a grant from the Henry Luce Foundation, explores the diverse traditions and experiences of Jews of Color in the United States in light of the complicated relationship that American Jewish communities have to white Christian supremacy and white privilege. Spearheaded by Samira Mehta (Associate Professor of Women and Gender Studies and Director of the Program in Jewish Studies), this groundbreaking partnership between the Program in Jewish Studies and University Libraries recovers, studies, and elevates the voices and experiences of Jews of color in the United States.
